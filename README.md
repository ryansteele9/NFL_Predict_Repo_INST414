## NFL Game Outcome Prediction Pipeline 2025
Predict NFL game point differentials for upcoming NFL weeks in 2025 NFL season. 
Model uses weekly team data, play-by-play analytics, Vegas odds, and other 
engineered features. 

This project implements an end-to-end machine learning pipeline following the
Cookiecutter Data Science structure. Requires API key from SportsDataIO 
(https://sportsdata.io/) to reproduce results.

## Project Statement
NFL games are unpredictable——game outcomes are affected by a host of factors, 
including, but not limited to, team-strength, opponent matchups, injuries, 
strategy, and a lot of randomness.
### Goal:
Build a data-driven model that predicts NFL game outcomes via game point 
differentials. Specifically, this project aims to predict future games in the
2025 season, using historical and 2025 season data. The objective is to predict
the outcome of any future NFL game with >55% accuracy.

## Datasets
| Data Type | Source | Size | Notes |
|----------:|:------:|:----:|:-----:|
| Weekly NFL data (2022-2025) | SportsDataIO (https://sportsdata.io/) | Records: 2024; Columns: 159 | API key required |
| Play-by-play EPA metrics | nflfastR (https://nflfastr.com/) | Records: 2019; Columns: 18 | Used to derive matchup strength features and other advanced metrics |
| Vegas Odds | SportsDataIO (https://sportsdata.io/) | Records: 1160; Columns: 10 | API key required |
| Current Injury Report | CBS Sports (https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/injuries/) | Records: 452; Columns: 4 | Only used for predicting future outcomes, not used in training model |
| Current Week NFL Schedule | SportsDataIO (https://sportsdata.io/) | Records: 15; Columns: 5 | API key required; only used for predicting games in upcoming week |
